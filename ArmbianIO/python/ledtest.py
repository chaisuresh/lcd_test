Simple LED blink
-------------
Using the NanoPi Duo connect a 220Î© resistor to the anode (the long pin of
the LED), then the resistor to 3.3 V, and connect the cathode (the short
pin) of the LED to pin 12 (IOG11). The anode of LED connects to a
current-limiting resistor and then to 3.3V. Therefore, to turn on an LED,
we need to make pin 12 low (0V) level. It can be realized by programming.
See images/ledtest.jpg for schematic.
